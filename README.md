# What is jai_odbc?
Jai ODBC is a simple wrapper for ODBC, which exposes a simple API to make SQL requests and parse it's data into structs. Currently it has only been used and tested on Windows with MSSQL and the `SQL Server Native Client 11.0 Driver`. If you have any feedback, or improvements feel free to ping me on the Discord. If you wanna contribute take a look in the [Contribution](#contribution) section.

# Installation
You need at least Jai `version beta 0.1.049` or higher. Download the repository and import it with `#import "jai_odbc";`. 

# API
* `connect:: (conn_str: string, location:= #caller_location) ->  (state: DB_Connection #must, success: bool)`<br>
Tries to connect to a database.
<br>Returns a DB_Connection object which you need to call `disconnect` on, when not needed anymore. **Even** when `false` was returned.

* `disconnect:: (state: *DB_Connection, location:= #caller_location)`<br>
Disconnects from the DB and frees the handles.

* `execute:: (using connection: *DB_Connection, $T: Type, command: string, args: .. Any, $ignore_unknown:= Unkown_Result_Mode.CRASH, location:= #caller_location) -> (success: bool, result_set_allocator: Pool #must, results: [] T, has_value: [] bool, modified_rows: int)`<br> 
Execute a sql command and parse the result into a given struct. Please use parameterized queries with '?' as a placeholder, insead of using string modifications on the command string, to avoid sql injections. 
<br>`results`, `has_value`, and `modified_rows` are undefined if `success` returned `false` 
<br>returns `true` if everything worked. `false` otherwise. Errors will be logged. 
<br><br>**NOTE**: This procedure returns a pool allocator that has to be `released(*pool)`       even if this procedure returns false.

* `execute:: inline (using connection: *DB_Connection, command: string, args: .. Any, location:= #caller_location) -> (success: bool, modified_rows: int)`<br>
This function should be used for statements that don't return data like UPDATE, DELETE etc. Everything else is the same with the exception, that nothing has to be freed after this call. It's done for you. For more information see notes for `execute`.

* `EXECUTE:: (using connection: *DB_Connection, $T: Type, command: string, args: .. Any, $ignore_unknown:= Unkown_Result_Mode.CRASH, location:= #caller_location) -> (success: bool, result_set_allocator: Pool #must, results: [] T, has_value: [] bool, modified_rows: int) #expand {`<br>
Wrapper for `execute` with the difference that it automatically frees the pool on end of scope(defer). For more information see notes for `execute`.

* `Integer` includes the types `s8`, `u8`, `s16`, `u16`, `s32`, `u32`, `s64`, `u64`.<br> NOTE: See [Known Problems](#known-problems)
* `SQLString` includes the types `char`, `varchar(max)`, `nchar`, `nvarchar(max)`
* `SQLBinary` includes the types `binary`, `varbinary`
* `SQLInteger` includes the types `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`, `BIGINT`
* `SQLFloat` only the default one without the bit specifier was tested.

# TODO
* Transaction management
* Multithreading?
* Reconnecting?
* Table name alias
* Maybe more conversions
* More Tests

# Known Problems
* Dont use the `SQL Server` Driver as it seems to break some functionality.
* Not sure, if full unsigned range works. Although the documentation mentions unsigned integer ranges, MSSQL doesn't seem to support them?. If anyone knows more about this, please contact me. They probably don't work with the full range. Be warned.
* I havent tested `char` and `varchar` with utf-8 enabled. Dont expect it to work. But maybe it does.

# Examples
```c
// Try to connect to the database.
state, connection_success:= connect("Driver={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};Server=MUPU;Database=Test;Trusted_Connection=Yes;");
assert(connection_success);
defer disconnect(*state); // Disconnect later on

{
    // Create struct which the result will map to.
    Dummy:: struct {
        testVal: string; // Has to match the sql column's name.
    }
    // Until there is column aliasing, you can rename the columns in the query to match the struct.
    success, result_set_allocator, results, has_value, modified_rows:= execute(*state, Dummy, "SELECT testString as testVal FROM Test");
    defer release(*result_set_allocator); // Free when done.
    assert(success);


    // Automatic free
    success, result_set_allocator, results, has_value, modified_rows:= EXECUTE(*state, JaiTest, "SELECT testBinary, testDouble FROM [Test]");
    assert(success);

    // Use this when u dont have any results.
    success, modified_rows:= execute(*state, "UPDATE [Test] SET testString = ", "test");

    // If your columns can be 'null', you can check for that by using 'has_value'
    //
    // NOTE: As of now this sucks. THE ORDER OF THE COLUMN IS THE SAME AS IN YOUR SQL QUERY! 
    // You retrieve the correct value by calculating the index like this:
    // 
    index_of_column:= row_0_index * results.count + column_0_index;
    if has_value[index_of_column] then return false;

}

{
    my_int:= 5;
    // Use this one without a Type, for queries that dont return data.
    success, rows:= execute(*state, "UPDATE Test SET testInt = ?", my_int); // Rows will tell you how many rows were modified.
    assert(success);
}
{
    Dummy:: struct {
        testVal: string;
    }
    // Frees automatically on scope end(defer)
    success, result_set_allocator, results, has_value, rows:= EXECUTE(*state, Dummy, "SELECT testString as testVal FROM Test WHERE testInt = ?", 8));
    assert(success);
}

```

# Contribution
## Guidelines
If you wanna contribute, feel free to make a pull request or open issues. If you do so, please name your commits as specified in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and/or use the githooks(See: [Tooling](#custom-git-hooks)) to enforce it.

## Style
For this project I have decided to try a new style. Also we will use snake case. Please try to follow this example when commiting code.
```c

//
// General definitions:
// - count is 1 based and used for counting
// - index is 0 based and used for i.e. for iterating
// - size is in bytes and used for i.e. keeping track of memory sizes
//
// Example:
//
// data: [10] u16;
// count = 10 elements
// size  = 20 bytes
// 
// index = it => for data {}


#import "Basic"; // imports and loads on top
#load "file.jai"; // imports and loads on top
DEBUG:: #import "Debug"; // no space, constants in capital latters

// Types have capital first latters
Unkown_Result_Mode:: enum {
    CRASH; // enum and enum_flags are capitalized
    WARN;
    SILENT;
}

// Types have capital first latters
Dummy_Thing:: struct { // brackets same line, no space between 'test1' and '::'
    decleration: int; // ':' go to identifier
    decleration_with_default: int = 5;
    CONSTANT:: 8;
    CONSTANT_WITH_TYPE: int : 8;

    // aligned values
    value0:     = 5;
    value1: int = 5;
    longer:     = 8;
    HELLO:      : 8; 
    PETER:  int : 8;
}

// identifiers use snake case
// name your return values if they are not SUPER obvious
test_long:: (text: string) -> name_return_values: bool {
{
}

test_modify:: (text: string) -> (name_return_values: bool) #modify { // put braket around return when using #modify
	return false;
}
{

}

// put brackets if multiple return values are there
// and only use #must for things that cannot be fixed when forgetting,
// like leaking memory like below
test2:: (text: string) -> (multiple: bool, return_values: *int #must) {

    b_exists:= text.count > 0; // DONT prefix with types or whatever

    prefixed_text:= tprint("HAHA: %\n", text); // always name variables smth usefull. And do not abbriviate.
    for value: 1..8 { // you can use 'it' though. just name it if its a bigger function so you dont have to scroll
        if value == {
            case 1; return....
            case; ....
        }
    }

    my_int:= New(int);
    
    my_int2, test:= function_with_multiple_returns(); // no space 

    return true, my_int;

}

MY_MACRO:: () #expand { // name macros in capital letters!

}

operator ==:: (a: int, b: int) {} // no space
blub:: (a:= 5, loc:= #caller_location) {} // no space

```


# Tooling
## Custom Git Hooks
To install them simply run `GIT_HOOKS_UNINSTALL.bat` after cloning.
To uninstall them run `GIT_HOOKS_UNINSTALL.bat`. 
<br>Currently distributed hooks are..
  - .. `nocheckin` - prevents commits that include the keyword **nocheckin**. So, whenever you want to 
      not forget, that you added/changed something temporarily, just add **nocheckin** anywhere. 
  - ..`conventional-commit-message` - prevents commits that don't follow the 
      [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) formatting.
